# KiCAD-ScrewHole-Project
This project allows the card designer to place Screws on the Schematic and have KiCAD track them through the process, and provide Screwhole Footprints at the board layout phase.  It supports non-plated through holes, plated through holes, and, plated through holes that attach to any net as defined in the schematic.
